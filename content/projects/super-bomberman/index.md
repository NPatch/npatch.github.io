## Unity

A remake from a project I did as part of a course at the university. It's the good oldie remade from C++ code to Unity mainly for educational purposes.

## C++

Currently refactoring the old project. Decided to switch from Allegro4 to SDL2, as Allegro4 was a pain to try and compile and I thought SDL is more widely used
so it would be a better choice. I could have easily used bgfx, which I have used at work before, but I figured, good opportunity to use SDL as well.
