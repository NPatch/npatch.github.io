I'm a computer science post-graduate mainly interested in game development and adventure games in particular(not that i would say no to other kinds).

So far only one game i've participated in developing for a university course which I remade using Unity3D.But I'm a credited beta tester for Resonance,Primordia(published by Wadjet Eye Games) and Blackwell Epiphany.
