I'm a former research staff engineer from Greece. I have worked on a variety of subjets including AR, VR, MoCap, Photogrammetry and 3D Scanning. My main interests are tooling, automation and game development.

When I'm not working, I test adventure games for fun. I'm a credited beta tester for a few games by Wadjet Eye Games, SkyGoblin, The Sleeping Machine AB and Venture Moon Industries.
