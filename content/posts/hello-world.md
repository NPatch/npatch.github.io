title = 'Hello World'

Every very first thing in computer related activities has to start with a hello world equivalent.

Just recently I recommended blogging to someone else ready to create their own game and I felt I simply had to do it myself as the teacher.There are a couple of sayings about this that come to mind.

"You, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?" -Romans 2:21

"Teacher,that you taught,and you do not keep your word" -rough translation of a greek saying

So this is an attempt to remedy myself.Hopefully the posts will be frequent and full of updates to my own projects in order for this blog to have meaning.
