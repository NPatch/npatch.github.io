New optimized version of the game with major overhaul work in the backbone.

Much better and efficient pooling of objects. Animation has been revamped as well.

As did many other parts that would require I go into a lengthy post.

Bottomline, optimizations were made in most parts of the project.

Next in line to tackle are PowerUps as well as the Menu and the Load from file feature that will enable you to load from custom levels. Afterwards I will try my hands on an editor which will ease the process of creating a custom level.
