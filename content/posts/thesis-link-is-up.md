After finishing my Bachelor's thesis, my supervisor advised me to make a website and host it.

Whoever wants to take a look please do so. Also feel free to download the script framework and use it directly or even as a reference to automate your Maya projects.

It is the one thing I will recommend fully for anyone using Maya. It will cut your time redoing work in half.And if it doesn't it will cut the effort given very short.The script relies on code and code changes only from what you write and is not affected by other factors.For example,you might miss something when redoing work or you might not do it as well as the previous time.With code you can set things in stone and go crazy with errors knowing that fixing something will fix it and not mess up things that should have remained intact.
