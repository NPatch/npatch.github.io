It's been a while from the previous post yet again. I've stopped working on Super Bomberman and have put it's Android version on the backburner(achieving a good enough control scheme was a bit difficult and I wasn't satisfied with any of the ones I tried in order to share it). But there's a new project underway. I've been working on a collaboration project called Eve of Ebon with the talented people of Phantom5 Studio for about two months now(it'll be two months in a week or so).
